# House Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

## Project Aim
Build a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on:
- Number of bedrooms
- Square footage (sqft)

## Description
This project uses a dataset containing house features and their prices. Using Python and Scikit-learn, it trains a linear regression model to predict house prices from given features. The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R² Score.

## Dataset
The dataset used (`house_data.csv`) contains:
- bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house
- sqft: Size of the house in square feet
- price: Price of the house

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`.
3. Run all cells to perform data analysis, train the model, and evaluate predictions.

## Output
- Visualizations of the data and correlations.
- Trained linear regression model.
- Model evaluation results (Mean Squared Error, R² Score).
- Scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted prices.

## Files Included
- `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations.
- `house_data.csv` — Sample dataset.
- `README.md` — Project documentation.
